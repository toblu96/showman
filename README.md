# Application Setup

## Keycloak

Keycloak is used for local user authentication. To initially setup the provider, do the following steps on the keycloak instance after spinning up the docker compose file.

1. create new realm `showman`
2. create new client `showman-auth`

```yaml
Client ID: showman-auth
Name: Showman Auth Client
# values for dev - add others for production
Root Url: http://localhost:8081
Home Url: http://localhost:3000
Valid redirect URIs: http://localhost:3000/*

Client authentication: on
```

3. Create User for new client
4. Update the `.env` file with the keycloak credentials

## YugabyteDB

YugabyteDB serves as the primary database for application state. It's a cloud native database which is compatible with Postgres, prepared for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments and 100% open source.

1. Start the DB using the compose file
2. Open the exposed Admin UI on port 9000 (http://localhost:9000/)
3. Add the db endpoint to the `.env` file

```dotenv
# yugabytedb
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://yugabyte:yugabyte@localhost:5433/yugabyte"
```

4. Init the database by adding the schema - run `npx prisma db push`
